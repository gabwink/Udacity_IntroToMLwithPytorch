# Intro to ML with Pytorch

This webpage serves as a summary of the projects and excercises completed during the course Intro to ML with Pytorch offered by Udacity. It also serves as a place to store the notes I took during the course. Many of the directories have README files that provide overviews of the concepts learned. Many of the notes and images come directly form the website.
